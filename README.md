# Loose Fruit
Is an immersive interactive digital (due to current circumstances) installation that explores the never ending variety of techno music uniquely performed by you and the “unmusical objects”. Each fruit has its own colour and sound followed by an audio responsive image. It is up to you when the unmusical fruit let loose and start having a boogie!

In order to interact with Loose Fruit (unfortunatly without the fruit as it is a physical interactive part created with MakeyMakey microcontroller board), you have to download the finalversioncode.pde and the sound files (wav) from the CODE folder. Then create a folder called "finalversioncode" with all the downloaded files and open it in Processing. Pressing keys "w,s,f,h" on your computer are equivalent to what touch the fruit would do. 

However, I wanted anyone to be able to see what the piece would look like if it was to be physically exhibited. So I uploaded a folder called FinalProject2020 which contains all the work in progress files (such as videos and screenshots of code) starting from the initial prototype all the way to the final version. The final version is a video that shows what it would look like and how people would interact with it. 

Let loose and listen to some good music!
